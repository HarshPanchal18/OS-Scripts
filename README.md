# MyShellScript

A collection of simple bash scripts to do stuff.

I'm falling in love with bash and will probably add new scripts to the collection and improve existing ones.

execution steps:

Give the file permission to execute by using `chmod` command and put `+x` for execution.
```
chmod +x file.sh
```
And then execute by following
```
./file.sh
```
or
```
bash file.sh
```

Feel free to contribute!
