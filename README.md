# MyShellScript

* I'm falling in love with bash and will probably add new scripts to the collection and improve existing ones.

* Some handy scripts I tend to need all around.

* A collection of generally useful set of scipts and snippets, and configs.

* Rather than a set of gists to copy paste, this is a repository of multiple files that can be deployed collectively.

* There's a lot of old stuff from my early linux-learning days, and a lot of horrible bash code. Please don't judge on these contents ;-)
